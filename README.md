# "Reform" - Mount & Blade II Bannerlod Mod 

## Design Principles.

Mount and Blade Warband was my favorite game and have been following M&B since 2007. M&B original module system was not very moddable compared to the new Bannerlord.
Since the release of M&B, I have grown from a teenage into a adult. I hope to use my spare time to create an M&B Bannerlord mod that are lore friendly and injected with my personal understanding of the world. I belive war is resulted from failed economic and polictical policies and every action has consequences. Bannerlord already has a framework for a working economy: supply and demand. Although the diploymatic system is not finished, it has a good footing. My eventual goal is to make M&B Bannerlord campaign system mimic Crusader Kings from Paradox studio.

So here are the two things I would follow in the mod

1. Realism is prioritized before Gameplay.
2. Economic and Political Overhaul.

## Future work

Not planned in any order.

1. Give relationship a reason instead of a cumulative of good/bad events, much more like crusader kings.
2. Prosperity should have an effect on milita. Higher prosperity should affect more milita.
3. Make a fully working economy. Hearth/Prosperity should really be population. Recuits should reduce population. Divide the labor into mutliple categories: teen, adults, old. teen and old are not part of working force and thus not bring any economy. Adults is the main work force but recruits reduces their number.
4. Soldier can be upgraded in skills but not their armor or weapon. Basically allow experienced under equiped soldiers and unexperienced over equiped soliders.
For example, 
If a lord has money, they should be able to give recruits good armor and weapon. On the contrary, if a lord doesn't have money, even though the soldier hired can be experienced, their equipment might not be.

## Release Logs

#### v0.01

1. Manually tweaked Building from Settlement and Castle to take longer to build and gives better building effects, such as food, prosperity and militia.

2. Manually tweaked item effects on food, prosperity and production from settlement consumption. Bannerlord settlement consumes grain and treat the consumption as food for each settlement, but this effect is discounted greatly for fish and meat as if fish and meat are not primary source of food.
