# "Reform" - Mount & Blade II Bannerlod Mod 

## Design Principles.

Mount and Blade Warband was my favorite game and have been following M&B since 2007. M&B original module system was not very moddable compared to the new Bannerlord.
Since the release of M&B, I have grown from a teenage into a adult. I hope to use my spare time to create an M&B Bannerlord mod that are lore friendly and injected with my personal understanding of the world. I belive war is resulted from failed economic and polictical policies and every action has consequences. Bannerlord already has a framework for a working economy: supply and demand. Although the diploymatic system is not finished, it has a good footing. My eventual goal is to make M&B Bannerlord campaign system mimic Crusader Kings from Paradox studio.

So here are the two things I would follow in the mod

1. Realism is prioritized before Gameplay.
2. Economic and Political Overhaul.

## Future work

Future Plans

Design Principles
Equilibrium.
Every action you take has consequences.
War is last resort of failed political and economical policy

Political Reform
Rework of opinion system
Opinion systems should be changed to like Civilization or EU4 instead of accumulated events(opinion) of what happened.

Political Conflicts
Political Party conflicts
Political parties in a kingdom have different conflicts. For example, aggressive vs conservative.

Vassal vs King
King made decisions that will change the opinions of vassals. King depends on vassals to fight a war. An overpowering vassal is dangerous because it might take over the kingdom so the king’s job is to keep balance of power as well as keep every vassal happy.

Peasant (levy) or landowner (noble) vs King
Benefits made to peasants will help the economy but at risk of anger the vassals who own the peasants. Angry peasants damage the foundation of the country and angry vassals will revolt.

Alliances and Betrayal
Some random events will happen that kings need to make a difficult choice. The action will have consequences. Those events might be triggered by a vassal or landlord that has a different opinion than current policy.

Economical Reform
Population
Population plays an important economical role in medieval times. A larger population means more peasants, more income, more levies.

Migration - People will move if there are significant benefits migrating to a new town.

Raids will cause panic and significantly reduce population.

Levies reduce the male & working population. Militia helps defending while still able to perform regular household production.

Nobles are from landowners. Landowners are managing peasants and provide stronger fightable noble warriors.

Production (Producers and Consumers)
Levies come from peasants, with basic armor. King and Vassals can choose to provide extra armor, weapon. And those will cost materials and labor. Materials and labors can be representable by money. Money fluctuates according to supply and demand.

War
War should have significant economical consequences. War without a proper casus belli is treated with significant diplomacy penalties.

Trade
Friendly countries can trade. Trade with materials, labor and produced works for the benefits of both sides.
